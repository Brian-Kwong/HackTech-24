# HackTech-24

## Inspiration
  
  - Our team believes that effective organization leads to an improvement in education, workforce, and in public health.  We developed our project to help others stay   organized. 

  - Being disorganized may cause stress and discomfort that may lead to a reduction in our productivity and motivation. Our program does the dirty work so you can worry about the important things. 

## What it does
   - Whether it's working on homework or hacking our next hackathon, the swamp of tabs causes too much clutter and confusion. In all the messiness, why bother sorting your tabs when Tabby can do it for you? Our cute Tabby cat serves as your personal assistant to group all of your tabs automatically. Tabby can group your tabs either by domain name or by categories through AI-based clustering algorithms. 

## How we built it
  - We evenly divided ourselves to work on the website and the AI model simultaneously. We created a Google Chrome extension integrated with an AI model to recognize key terms and group tabs accordingly. 

## Challenges we ran into
- Creating artwork, design. and UI.
- Working with Google and AI APIs.
- Develop vectors for K-means clustering.
- No food :c (no money, no housing, no break)


## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Cute artwork.
- Practical to use in everyday tasks.
- Consistently functional and reliable.
- We finished! :P

## What we learned
- How to create Google Chrome extensions.
- Utilizing AI APIs to create K-means clustering.
- Working as a team! :D

## Running the AI Model

- You will need Python 3 installed on your computer along with the following pip modules
```
pip install sentence-transformers
pip install flask
pip install flask-restful
pip install flask-cors
```

Then to start the AI
```
./backend/api.py
```




What's next for Tabby
Improve on AI model for better consistency
Customization colors for group tabs.
More efficient and optimal AI models.
